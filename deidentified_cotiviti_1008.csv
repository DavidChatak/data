Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on
DWeb

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

and Recommendations: 1: Negative -- Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 2: Benign appearance or behavior. - Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 3: Probably benign -- Recommend low-dose CT in 6 months. 4A: Probably suspicious (5-15% of
malignancy)--recommend low-dose CT in 3 months. PET/CT may be used when there is a a solid component
of at least 8 mm. 4B: Suspicious (greater than 15% chance of malignancy)-options for additional evaluation
include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are
imaging that increases the suspicion of malignancy. Recommendation same as 4B. S: Other clinically
significant or potentially clinically significant findings-recommendation depends on finding. <DATE> 7:09 AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are

PMD: No primary care provider on file. Hospital Course: Patient is a <AGE> <SEX> who is a known smoker. Her daughter is at bedside is
provide me with HPI is patient is currently on BiPAP and lethargic. The patient continues to smoke 1-2
packs per day since she was a teenager so she probably has approximately a 40-80 pack-year history. The patient was acting ""confused all day"" and her daughter decided to check her oxygen level on
room air. Her pulse OX was 50%. She gave her breathing treatment and rechecked and then it was
40%. At this point the daughter called EMS and was brought into the emergency room for evaluation. <NAME> denies any recent complains of fever, chills, sputum production, chest pain. She states that
she was complaining of some right arm pain and headache but the patient often has these complaints. Patient has been put on BiPAP. <DATE> AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

CT LOW DOSE LUNG SCREENING HISTORY: Lung cancer screening COMPARISON: <DATE> Automated
exposure control was also utilized to decrease patient radiation dose. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the
chest was performed using low-dose protocol. FINDINGS: Nodules: Stable granuloma left upper lobe Other
lung findings: The lungs are clear. Airway: The airway is patent. Pleura: No mass or fluid collection. Great
vessels: Atherosclerosis is seen. There is no aneurysm identified. Heart and pericardium: Heart is normal in
size. No pericardial effusion. Lymph nodes: No pathologic lymphadenopathy is noted. Bones and soft tissues:
No acute osseous or soft tissue abnormality is seen. Upper abdomen: No acute process is seen in the upper
abdomen. : 1. <LOCATION> 2. Benign findings 2. Patient can return in <DATE> ACR Lung-RADS version 1.1 Categories
and Recommendations: 1: Negative -- Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 2: Benign appearance or behavior. - Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 3: Probably benign -- Recommend low-dose CT in 6 months. 4A: Probably suspicious (5-15% of
malignancy)--recommend low-dose CT in 3 months. PET/CT may be used when there is a a solid component
of at least 8 mm. 4B: Suspicious (greater than 15% chance of malignancy)-options for additional evaluation
include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are
imaging that increases the suspicion of malignancy. Recommendation same as 4B. S: Other clinically
significant or potentially clinically significant findings-recommendation depends on finding. <DATE> 7:09 AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are

PMD: No primary care provider on file. Hospital Course: Patient is a <AGE> <SEX> who is a known smoker. Her daughter is at bedside is
provide me with HPI is patient is currently on BiPAP and lethargic. The patient continues to smoke 1-2
packs per day since she was a teenager so she probably has approximately a 40-80 pack-year history. The patient was acting ""confused all day"" and her daughter decided to check her oxygen level on
room air. Her pulse OX was 50%. She gave her breathing treatment and rechecked and then it was
40%. At this point the daughter called EMS and was brought into the emergency room for evaluation. <NAME> denies any recent complains of fever, chills, sputum production, chest pain. She states that
she was complaining of some right arm pain and headache but the patient often has these complaints. Patient has been put on BiPAP. <DATE> AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

CT LOW DOSE LUNG SCREENING HISTORY: Lung cancer screening COMPARISON: <DATE> Automated
exposure control was also utilized to decrease patient radiation dose. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the
chest was performed using low-dose protocol. FINDINGS: Nodules: Stable granuloma left upper lobe Other
lung findings: The lungs are clear. Airway: The airway is patent. Pleura: No mass or fluid collection. Great
vessels: Atherosclerosis is seen. There is no aneurysm identified. Heart and pericardium: Heart is normal in
size. No pericardial effusion. Lymph nodes: No pathologic lymphadenopathy is noted. Bones and soft tissues:
No acute osseous or soft tissue abnormality is seen. Upper abdomen: No acute process is seen in the upper
abdomen. : 1. <LOCATION> 2. Benign findings 2. Patient can return in <DATE> ACR Lung-RADS version 1.1 Categories
and Recommendations: 1: Negative -- Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 2: Benign appearance or behavior. - Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 3: Probably benign -- Recommend low-dose CT in 6 months. 4A: Probably suspicious (5-15% of
malignancy)--recommend low-dose CT in 3 months. PET/CT may be used when there is a a solid component
of at least 8 mm. 4B: Suspicious (greater than 15% chance of malignancy)-options for additional evaluation
include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are
imaging that increases the suspicion of malignancy. Recommendation same as 4B. S: Other clinically
significant or potentially clinically significant findings-recommendation depends on finding. <DATE> 7:09 AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are

PMD: No primary care provider on file. Hospital Course: Patient is a <AGE> <SEX> who is a known smoker. Her daughter is at bedside is
provide me with HPI is patient is currently on BiPAP and lethargic. The patient continues to smoke 1-2
packs per day since she was a teenager so she probably has approximately a 40-80 pack-year history. The patient was acting ""confused all day"" and her daughter decided to check her oxygen level on
room air. Her pulse OX was 50%. She gave her breathing treatment and rechecked and then it was
40%. At this point the daughter called EMS and was brought into the emergency room for evaluation. <NAME> denies any recent complains of fever, chills, sputum production, chest pain. She states that
she was complaining of some right arm pain and headache but the patient often has these complaints. Patient has been put on BiPAP. <DATE> AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

CT LOW DOSE LUNG SCREENING HISTORY: Lung cancer screening COMPARISON: <DATE> Automated
exposure control was also utilized to decrease patient radiation dose. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the
chest was performed using low-dose protocol. FINDINGS: Nodules: Stable granuloma left upper lobe Other
lung findings: The lungs are clear. Airway: The airway is patent. Pleura: No mass or fluid collection. Great
vessels: Atherosclerosis is seen. There is no aneurysm identified. Heart and pericardium: Heart is normal in
size. No pericardial effusion. Lymph nodes: No pathologic lymphadenopathy is noted. Bones and soft tissues:
No acute osseous or soft tissue abnormality is seen. Upper abdomen: No acute process is seen in the upper
abdomen. : 1. <LOCATION> 2. Benign findings 2. Patient can return in <DATE> ACR Lung-RADS version 1.1 Categories
and Recommendations: 1: Negative -- Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 2: Benign appearance or behavior. - Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 3: Probably benign -- Recommend low-dose CT in 6 months. 4A: Probably suspicious (5-15% of
malignancy)--recommend low-dose CT in 3 months. PET/CT may be used when there is a a solid component
of at least 8 mm. 4B: Suspicious (greater than 15% chance of malignancy)-options for additional evaluation
include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are
imaging that increases the suspicion of malignancy. Recommendation same as 4B. S: Other clinically
significant or potentially clinically significant findings-recommendation depends on finding. <DATE> 7:09 AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are

PMD: No primary care provider on file. Hospital Course: Patient is a <AGE> <SEX> who is a known smoker. Her daughter is at bedside is
provide me with HPI is patient is currently on BiPAP and lethargic. The patient continues to smoke 1-2
packs per day since she was a teenager so she probably has approximately a 40-80 pack-year history. The patient was acting ""confused all day"" and her daughter decided to check her oxygen level on
room air. Her pulse OX was 50%. She gave her breathing treatment and rechecked and then it was
40%. At this point the daughter called EMS and was brought into the emergency room for evaluation. <NAME> denies any recent complains of fever, chills, sputum production, chest pain. She states that
she was complaining of some right arm pain and headache but the patient often has these complaints. Patient has been put on BiPAP. <DATE> AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

CT LOW DOSE LUNG SCREENING HISTORY: Lung cancer screening COMPARISON: <DATE> Automated
exposure control was also utilized to decrease patient radiation dose. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the
chest was performed using low-dose protocol. FINDINGS: Nodules: Stable granuloma left upper lobe Other
lung findings: The lungs are clear. Airway: The airway is patent. Pleura: No mass or fluid collection. Great
vessels: Atherosclerosis is seen. There is no aneurysm identified. Heart and pericardium: Heart is normal in
size. No pericardial effusion. Lymph nodes: No pathologic lymphadenopathy is noted. Bones and soft tissues:
No acute osseous or soft tissue abnormality is seen. Upper abdomen: No acute process is seen in the upper
abdomen. : 1. <LOCATION> 2. Benign findings 2. Patient can return in <DATE> ACR Lung-RADS version 1.1 Categories
and Recommendations: 1: Negative -- Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 2: Benign appearance or behavior. - Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 3: Probably benign -- Recommend low-dose CT in 6 months. 4A: Probably suspicious (5-15% of
malignancy)--recommend low-dose CT in 3 months. PET/CT may be used when there is a a solid component
of at least 8 mm. 4B: Suspicious (greater than 15% chance of malignancy)-options for additional evaluation
include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are
imaging that increases the suspicion of malignancy. Recommendation same as 4B. S: Other clinically
significant or potentially clinically significant findings-recommendation depends on finding. <DATE> 7:09 AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are

PMD: No primary care provider on file. Hospital Course: Patient is a <AGE> <SEX> who is a known smoker. Her daughter is at bedside is
provide me with HPI is patient is currently on BiPAP and lethargic. The patient continues to smoke 1-2
packs per day since she was a teenager so she probably has approximately a 40-80 pack-year history. The patient was acting ""confused all day"" and her daughter decided to check her oxygen level on
room air. Her pulse OX was 50%. She gave her breathing treatment and rechecked and then it was
40%. At this point the daughter called EMS and was brought into the emergency room for evaluation. <NAME> denies any recent complains of fever, chills, sputum production, chest pain. She states that
she was complaining of some right arm pain and headache but the patient often has these complaints. Patient has been put on BiPAP. <DATE> AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

CT LOW DOSE LUNG SCREENING HISTORY: Lung cancer screening COMPARISON: <DATE> Automated
exposure control was also utilized to decrease patient radiation dose. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the
chest was performed using low-dose protocol. FINDINGS: Nodules: Stable granuloma left upper lobe Other
lung findings: The lungs are clear. Airway: The airway is patent. Pleura: No mass or fluid collection. Great
vessels: Atherosclerosis is seen. There is no aneurysm identified. Heart and pericardium: Heart is normal in
size. No pericardial effusion. Lymph nodes: No pathologic lymphadenopathy is noted. Bones and soft tissues:
No acute osseous or soft tissue abnormality is seen. Upper abdomen: No acute process is seen in the upper
abdomen. : 1. <LOCATION> 2. Benign findings 2. Patient can return in <DATE> ACR Lung-RADS version 1.1 Categories
and Recommendations: 1: Negative -- Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 2: Benign appearance or behavior. - Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 3: Probably benign -- Recommend low-dose CT in 6 months. 4A: Probably suspicious (5-15% of
malignancy)--recommend low-dose CT in 3 months. PET/CT may be used when there is a a solid component
of at least 8 mm. 4B: Suspicious (greater than 15% chance of malignancy)-options for additional evaluation
include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are
imaging that increases the suspicion of malignancy. Recommendation same as 4B. S: Other clinically
significant or potentially clinically significant findings-recommendation depends on finding. <DATE> 7:09 AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are

PMD: No primary care provider on file. Hospital Course: Patient is a <AGE> <SEX> who is a known smoker. Her daughter is at bedside is
provide me with HPI is patient is currently on BiPAP and lethargic. The patient continues to smoke 1-2
packs per day since she was a teenager so she probably has approximately a 40-80 pack-year history. The patient was acting ""confused all day"" and her daughter decided to check her oxygen level on
room air. Her pulse OX was 50%. She gave her breathing treatment and rechecked and then it was
40%. At this point the daughter called EMS and was brought into the emergency room for evaluation. <NAME> denies any recent complains of fever, chills, sputum production, chest pain. She states that
she was complaining of some right arm pain and headache but the patient often has these complaints. Patient has been put on BiPAP. <DATE> AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

CT LOW DOSE LUNG SCREENING HISTORY: Lung cancer screening COMPARISON: <DATE> Automated
exposure control was also utilized to decrease patient radiation dose. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the
chest was performed using low-dose protocol. FINDINGS: Nodules: Stable granuloma left upper lobe Other
lung findings: The lungs are clear. Airway: The airway is patent. Pleura: No mass or fluid collection. Great
vessels: Atherosclerosis is seen. There is no aneurysm identified. Heart and pericardium: Heart is normal in
size. No pericardial effusion. Lymph nodes: No pathologic lymphadenopathy is noted. Bones and soft tissues:
No acute osseous or soft tissue abnormality is seen. Upper abdomen: No acute process is seen in the upper
abdomen. : 1. <LOCATION> 2. Benign findings 2. Patient can return in <DATE> ACR Lung-RADS version 1.1 Categories
and Recommendations: 1: Negative -- Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 2: Benign appearance or behavior. - Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 3: Probably benign -- Recommend low-dose CT in 6 months. 4A: Probably suspicious (5-15% of
malignancy)--recommend low-dose CT in 3 months. PET/CT may be used when there is a a solid component
of at least 8 mm. 4B: Suspicious (greater than 15% chance of malignancy)-options for additional evaluation
include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are
imaging that increases the suspicion of malignancy. Recommendation same as 4B. S: Other clinically
significant or potentially clinically significant findings-recommendation depends on finding. <DATE> 7:09 AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are

PMD: No primary care provider on file. Hospital Course: Patient is a <AGE> <SEX> who is a known smoker. Her daughter is at bedside is
provide me with HPI is patient is currently on BiPAP and lethargic. The patient continues to smoke 1-2
packs per day since she was a teenager so she probably has approximately a 40-80 pack-year history. The patient was acting ""confused all day"" and her daughter decided to check her oxygen level on
room air. Her pulse OX was 50%. She gave her breathing treatment and rechecked and then it was
40%. At this point the daughter called EMS and was brought into the emergency room for evaluation. <NAME> denies any recent complains of fever, chills, sputum production, chest pain. She states that
she was complaining of some right arm pain and headache but the patient often has these complaints. Patient has been put on BiPAP. <DATE> AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

CT LOW DOSE LUNG SCREENING HISTORY: Lung cancer screening COMPARISON: <DATE> Automated
exposure control was also utilized to decrease patient radiation dose. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the
chest was performed using low-dose protocol. FINDINGS: Nodules: Stable granuloma left upper lobe Other
lung findings: The lungs are clear. Airway: The airway is patent. Pleura: No mass or fluid collection. Great
vessels: Atherosclerosis is seen. There is no aneurysm identified. Heart and pericardium: Heart is normal in
size. No pericardial effusion. Lymph nodes: No pathologic lymphadenopathy is noted. Bones and soft tissues:
No acute osseous or soft tissue abnormality is seen. Upper abdomen: No acute process is seen in the upper
abdomen. : 1. <LOCATION> 2. Benign findings 2. Patient can return in <DATE> ACR Lung-RADS version 1.1 Categories
and Recommendations: 1: Negative -- Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 2: Benign appearance or behavior. - Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 3: Probably benign -- Recommend low-dose CT in 6 months. 4A: Probably suspicious (5-15% of
malignancy)--recommend low-dose CT in 3 months. PET/CT may be used when there is a a solid component
of at least 8 mm. 4B: Suspicious (greater than 15% chance of malignancy)-options for additional evaluation
include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are
imaging that increases the suspicion of malignancy. Recommendation same as 4B. S: Other clinically
significant or potentially clinically significant findings-recommendation depends on finding. <DATE> 7:09 AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are

PMD: No primary care provider on file. Hospital Course: Patient is a <AGE> <SEX> who is a known smoker. Her daughter is at bedside is
provide me with HPI is patient is currently on BiPAP and lethargic. The patient continues to smoke 1-2
packs per day since she was a teenager so she probably has approximately a 40-80 pack-year history. The patient was acting ""confused all day"" and her daughter decided to check her oxygen level on
room air. Her pulse OX was 50%. She gave her breathing treatment and rechecked and then it was
40%. At this point the daughter called EMS and was brought into the emergency room for evaluation. <NAME> denies any recent complains of fever, chills, sputum production, chest pain. She states that
she was complaining of some right arm pain and headache but the patient often has these complaints. Patient has been put on BiPAP. <DATE> AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

CT LOW DOSE LUNG SCREENING HISTORY: Lung cancer screening COMPARISON: <DATE> Automated
exposure control was also utilized to decrease patient radiation dose. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the
chest was performed using low-dose protocol. FINDINGS: Nodules: Stable granuloma left upper lobe Other
lung findings: The lungs are clear. Airway: The airway is patent. Pleura: No mass or fluid collection. Great
vessels: Atherosclerosis is seen. There is no aneurysm identified. Heart and pericardium: Heart is normal in
size. No pericardial effusion. Lymph nodes: No pathologic lymphadenopathy is noted. Bones and soft tissues:
No acute osseous or soft tissue abnormality is seen. Upper abdomen: No acute process is seen in the upper
abdomen. : 1. <LOCATION> 2. Benign findings 2. Patient can return in <DATE> ACR Lung-RADS version 1.1 Categories
and Recommendations: 1: Negative -- Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 2: Benign appearance or behavior. - Recommend continued annual screening with low-dose CT in <DATE>. 3: Probably benign -- Recommend low-dose CT in 6 months. 4A: Probably suspicious (5-15% of
malignancy)--recommend low-dose CT in 3 months. PET/CT may be used when there is a a solid component
of at least 8 mm. 4B: Suspicious (greater than 15% chance of malignancy)-options for additional evaluation
include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are
imaging that increases the suspicion of malignancy. Recommendation same as 4B. S: Other clinically
significant or potentially clinically significant findings-recommendation depends on finding. <DATE> 7:09 AM

Procalcitonin Normals
GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically

Old charts were reviewed per <LOCATION> EMR. Pertinent details are summarized above. All laboratory, radiologic, and EKG studies that were performed in the Emergency Department were a
necessary part of the evaluation needed to exclude unstable or emergent medical conditions. Patient presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia and is requiring supplemental
oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation level. Patient has a significantly elevated pCO2 of 97.4mmHg
and low pH of 7.19. Patient is placed on BiPAP. Patient is given IV Solu-Medrol and DuoNeb for treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation. EKG, chest x-ray, and lab results noted. Respiratory swab is negative for RSV/influenza/COVID-19. Re-evaluation at 7:57 p.m.: Patient's family member is now in the room. Patient is on BiPAP and has oxygen
saturation reading of 97% on the monitor. However, she is very difficult to arouse, and I will have respiratory
therapy repeat ABG to reassess pCO2, as the patient may need intubated. Will re-evaluate. Re-evaluation at 8:06 p.m.: The patient is now awake and interactive and states she is feeling better, and it
seems the patient was in a very sound sleep when I was just in the room trying to wake her. Awaiting
respiratory therapy to do repeat ABG. Repeat ABG shows slight improvement in pCO2 to 94.0mmHg and slight improvement in pH to 7.21. <DATE> 7:09 AM

GENERAL COMMENTS Antibiotic initiation should not be withheld for patients with
sepsis or
pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A low procalcitonin should prompt
the
investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status. Repeat
low
or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic
de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute
bronchitis,
COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of
clinically
significant bacterial infections. Please refer to the procalcitonin guidance document on

include chest CT, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on clinical morbidities. For new large nodules
developing on an <DATE> repeat screening CT, a one-month low-dose CT may be used to address potentially
infectious or inflammatory conditions. 4X: Suspicious --category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features are

PMD: No primary care provider on file. Hospital Course: Patient is a <AGE> <SEX> who is a known smoker. Her daughter is at bedside is
provide me with HPI is patient is currently on BiPAP and lethargic. The patient continues to smoke 1-2
packs per day since she was a teenager so she probably has approximately a 40-80 pack-year history. The patient was acting ""confused all day"" and her daughter decided to check her oxygen level on
room air. Her pulse OX was 50%. She gave her breathing treatment and rechecked and then it was
40%. At this point the daughter called EMS and was brought into the emergency room for evaluation. <NAME> denies any recent complains of fever, chills, sputum production, chest pain. She states that
she was complaining of some right arm pain and headache but the patient often has these complaints. Patient has been put on BiPAP. <DATE> AM
